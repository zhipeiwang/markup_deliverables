# Markup languages and reproducible programming in statistics

Deliverable 1: Reproducible research compendium.

Place the full contents of your research compendium in this directory. See course manual for requirements.


The compendium contains some work from the final assignment in the Bayesian course. It has three folders scripts, data and output. The scripts folder has the R script used to generate the datasets, the gibbs samplers used to run the bayesian regression, and some helper functions. The data folder contains the datasets generated using dataGen.R in the scripts folder. The outputs can also be obtained by running the run.R file under the scripts folder. One might run into working directory or other minor issues when running the run.R file, but it is likely to be easily fixed.
